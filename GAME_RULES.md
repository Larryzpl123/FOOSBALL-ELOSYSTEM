# Official Foosball Rules

## 1. Introduction
Foosball, or table soccer, is a dynamic game simulating soccer on a tabletop, governed by the [International Table Soccer Federation (ITSF)](https://www.tablesoccer.org). These rules, designed for tournament play, ensure fair and competitive gameplay but can be adapted for casual settings.

## 2. The Match
- A match typically consists of the best of 5 games.
- Each game is won by the first team to reach 5 points.
- If the score reaches 4-4, the game continues until one team leads by 2 points (deuce rule).

## 3. Starting the Match
- A coin flip determines which team chooses the table side or serves first.
- The winning team selects either to serve or choose a side; the decision is final.
- The match begins when the ball is put into play.
- Teams switch sides after each game, with a maximum of 90 seconds between games.

## 4. Serve and Ready Protocol
- The serve is executed from the middle player of the five-man rod.
- The server must ask, “Ready?” and the opponent has 3 seconds to respond.
- After confirmation, the server has 3 seconds to start the serve, moving the ball between two figures and waiting 1 second before advancing.
- Penalties for incorrect serving:
  - Serving from the wrong position before scoring: re-serve; subsequent violations lose possession.
  - Starting before “ready”: warning, then loss of possession.
  - Not following protocol: opponent chooses to continue or serve.

## 5. Subsequent Serves
- After the initial serve, the team last scored upon serves.
- In subsequent games, the team that lost the previous game serves first.
- If the wrong team serves and it’s discovered before scoring, play stops and corrects; after scoring, the point stands.

## 6. Ball in Play
- The ball remains in play until it goes off the table, becomes dead, a timeout is called, or a point is scored.

## 7. Ball Off the Table
- If the ball leaves the play area (e.g., hits scoring markers or external objects), it is placed at the opponent’s two-man rod.
- Aerial shots over opponent’s rods are illegal, resulting in loss of possession to the opponent’s five-man rod.

## 8. Dead Ball
- A ball is dead if it stops completely and is unreachable by any player figure.
- If between the five-man rods, it’s re-served by the team that conceded the last goal.
- If behind a midfield bar, it’s re-served by the nearest defender.
- Intentionally making the ball dead awards the serve to the opponent.

## 9. Time Out
- Each team has 2 timeouts per game, each up to 30 seconds.
- Timeouts can be called by the possessing team when the ball is stopped or by either team when the ball is not in play.
- Penalties:
  - Calling a timeout with a moving ball: loss of possession.
  - Exceeding 2 timeouts: warning, then technical foul.
  - Not ready after 30 seconds: delay of game penalty.

## 10. Resuming Play After a Time Out
- The ball is returned to the rod where it was when the timeout was called.
- If in play, the ready protocol must be followed.
- Illegal resumption: opponent chooses to continue or serve.

## 11. Official Time Out
- Used for disputes, table maintenance (e.g., broken figures), or medical issues (max 60 minutes, else forfeit).
- Does not count toward the 2 timeouts per game.

## 12. Point Scored
- A point is scored when the ball fully enters the goal, even if it bounces out.
- Controversial goals require an official’s decision; if inconclusive, the point does not count.
- Intentional false marking of a goal is a technical foul, possibly leading to forfeiture.

## 13. Table Sides
- Teams switch sides after each game, with a maximum of 90 seconds.
- Not being ready after 90 seconds results in a delay of game penalty.

## 14. Change of Positions
- In doubles, players must play designated rods and can switch only during timeouts, between points/games, or after technical fouls.
- Illegal switching during play is considered a distraction, requiring a return to original positions.

## 15. Spinning the Rods
- Spinning (rotating rods more than 360 degrees before/after striking the ball) is illegal.
- Penalty: opponent chooses to continue play or serve.
- Spinning without advancing the ball is not illegal but may be a distraction.

## 16. Jarring
- Jarring, sliding, or lifting the table while the ball is in play is illegal.
- Penalties:
  - First/second offense: opponent chooses to continue or serve.
  - Subsequent offenses: technical foul.

## 17. Reset
- Called if force impairs a shot/pass without losing possession; time limits are reset.
- Players choose to set up again or continue.
- Two resets per point; further resets result in a technical foul.

## 18. Reaching Into Playing Area
- Illegal without permission while the ball is in play.
- Penalties:
  - If ball is stopped: loss of possession.
  - If ball is moving: technical foul.
  - Preventing a goal: point awarded to opponent, served as a goal.

## 19. Alterations to Table
- No changes affecting play characteristics are allowed.
- Illegal substances (e.g., rosin) on the table require cleaning/replacement, with possible delay penalties or prohibition.

## 20. Distraction
- Movements or sounds away from the ball rod are distractions.
- Penalties:
  - First violation: warning or opponent’s choice.
  - Subsequent violations: possible technical foul.

## 21. Practice
- Allowed before the match and between games.
- Practicing during a game results in loss of possession; subsequent violations lead to technical fouls.

## 22. Language and Behavior
- Unsportsmanlike conduct, including cursing, results in technical fouls or possible forfeiture/expulsion.
- Coaching is permitted only during timeouts or between games.

## 23. Passing
- From the five-man rod, the ball must touch two figures before advancing to the three-man rod.
- Maximum of two wall strikes before passing or shooting.
- Penalties: opponent chooses to continue or serve.

## 24. Time of Possession
- Time limits:
  - Five-man rod: 10 seconds.
  - Other rods (e.g., goalie, three-man): 15 seconds.
- Penalty: loss of possession to the opponent’s goalie or forward for serve.

## 25. Delay of Game
- Play must be continuous, with a maximum of 5 seconds between scoring and the ready protocol.
- Penalties:
  - First infraction: warning.
  - Subsequent infractions: timeout charged, possible delay penalty.

## 26. Recalls and Forfeiture
- Teams not at the table within 3 minutes are recalled every 3 minutes.
- After the third recall, games are forfeited until the match is over.

## 27. Technical Fouls
- For flagrant or intentional violations, play stops, and the opponent gets the ball on the three-man rod for a free shot.
- Whether the shot scores or not, play resumes at the point of the foul.
